### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

> A paradigm shift in our ability to interact with and manage various devices and systems


Casting a digital thread across distances, electronic remote control empowers us to navigate and orchestrate our technological realms with precision, transcending physical boundaries and unlocking new dimensions of convenience and efficiency. RAY KURZWEIL once said "Electronic remote control has revolutionized the way we interact with technology, granting us the power to command and shape our digital environments from afar, transforming mere tools into extensions of our will." This means Elecetronic Remote control is the future, our future.

This project consisted in the design and implementation of a remote electronic systems control system using a mobile device: (Laptop, Tablet, Mobile Phone ...)
